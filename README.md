SporkPGM
========

Since Para is busy with other stuff, I though I would update SporkPGM and give it a few new features. 


How to set this thing up
------------------------
Compile or download a copy of Spork and place it into your plugins folder, if you want to use the compass it is currently required that you install WorldEdit along side it. Then, create a "maps" folder where you will put your maps. Make sure you have a map.xml file inside
or else it won't load. 

Thats about it!
