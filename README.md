SporkPGM
========

Since Para is busy with other stuff, I though I would update SporkPGM and give it a few new features. 


How to set this thing up
------------------------
Compile or download a copy of Spork and place it into your plugins folder, if you want to use the compass it is currently required that you install WorldEdit along side it. Then, create a "maps" folder where you will put your maps. Make sure you have a map.xml file inside
or else it won't load. 

Downloading Spork
----------------
To download Spork, head on over to [my build server][1] and download the latest woring build of Spork. Although the build succeeded, it doesn't mean that it is bug free, so be careful. If you want a (relatively) bug free version, dowload the recommended build.

The recommended build at this moment is: [#8][2]
<!--- Add one to the build you want to put on here, because Jenkins will build this commit -->

Thats about it!
