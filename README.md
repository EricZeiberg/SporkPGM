SporkPGM
========

ParaPGM - RELOADED! 


How to set this thing up
------------------------
Compile or download a copy of Spork and place it into your plugins folder, if you want to use the compass it is currently required that you install WorldEdit along side it. Then, create a "maps" folder where you will put your maps. Make sure you have a map.xml file inside
or else it won't load. 

Thats about it!
